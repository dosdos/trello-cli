# README #

This tool is a Python wrapper around Trello REST API (just a couple of them).

First, you need to get an API key from [Trello Developer API Keys page](https://trello.com/app-key).
Make sure to paste them in the `.env` file, that you need to create in the `trellocli` folder.
Look at the [.env.template](trellocli/.env.template) file to get an example.

Now you can run the script using `python -m`; the `-m` option helps to run the library module as a script.

Try it out:

```
$ python -m trellocli --help
```
